Amber Planet is a (work-in-progress) game about diving on an alien planet
and observing the behaviours of various plant and animal species.

In this game, I wanted to simulate a school of fish hunting a swarm of
shrimp. To accomplish the moving and hunting in loose swarms, I created
invisible "nucleus" objects that are the actual things chasing each other,
while the fish and shrimp and mainly trying to stay around the nuclei.
